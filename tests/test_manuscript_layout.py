"""Where the manuscript's source lives, and what each directory is allowed to hold.

The manuscript is one body of text typeset by several documents: a reading copy, one layout per journal and the supplement.
That only works if the content exists once. Two files carry it, sections/manuscript_body.tex listing the sections in
order and sections/manuscript_variables.tex listing the macro files the pipeline writes, and every document reads
those instead of repeating the lists. A document that repeats them drifts silently: it keeps compiling while a
section or a new step's macros are missing from it alone.

Both files are written by hand, so neither may sit in latex/, which holds nothing but build products. These tests pin
that split, and check that the two lists still match what is on disk.
